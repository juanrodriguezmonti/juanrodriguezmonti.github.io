# Welcome to my Blog

This is my first article using MDX, a format that combines the best of Markdown with the flexibility of React.

## Why MDX?

MDX allows us to write content using Markdown while maintaining the ability to use React components when we need them. This is perfect for:

- Technical content
- Interactive tutorials
- Code documentation
- Articles with dynamic elements

## Code Example

Here's a Python code example with syntax highlighting:

```python
def fibonacci(n: int) -> int:
    """Calculate the nth Fibonacci number."""
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

# Usage example
result = fibonacci(10)
print(f"The tenth Fibonacci number is: {result}")
```

We can also show JavaScript code:

```javascript
const greeting = (name) => {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};

console.log(greeting("World"));
```

## Styles and Formatting

MDX also supports **bold**, *italic*, and ~~strikethrough~~.

> This is a blockquote that can be useful for highlighting important information.

### Lists

1. First option
2. Second option
3. Third option

- Unordered list
- Another item
- And another one

This is just the beginning. In future articles, we'll explore more advanced topics and share detailed technical knowledge.
