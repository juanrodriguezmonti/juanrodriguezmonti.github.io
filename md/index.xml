      <description>Art creation with Python, Machine Learning and Language Processing During the time that I spent on the weekend reading about new things and stuff that I consider awesome, I dive into an interesting and emerging field of AI which is Images and Art Creation.
To be more specific, I started to work with models that create images, pixel art, and art, and I found it incredible.
Some work performed here is related to upcoming academic works, so this is half for fun and half academic related stuff.</description>
