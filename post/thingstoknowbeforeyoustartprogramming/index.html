    <p>Some days ago, I was reading Guido Van Rossum&rsquo;s Google Plus Page, and I found a link that he shared under this description &ldquo;I was so impressed with this I am posting it to G+ and tweeting it &ldquo;. As I admire a lot this guy, because he is the creator of the greatest programming language ever existed, I inmediately opened it. The story is about the things and warnings you should know before you start programming, under the title; Things I Wish Someone Had Told Me When I Was Learning How to Code. This is the link to the article.</p>
<p>I agree with the author, Cecily Carver. There are some things that are really important to know before you start as a programmer because there is a big gap that arises when you are a newbie and you should be prepared to face it. This is: After learning the basics, the Python 101 or Java 101, ( variables, methods, functions, conditionals, and all that stuff ) you are completely lost, and without any clue about how to move forward, and wondering &ldquo;Is this programming?&rdquo; &ldquo;Am I gonna be the future GVR&rdquo;. Short answer: No. Learning new things is one of the most amazing experiences you might feel, but in this case, if you don&rsquo;t know what you want from &ldquo;Programming&rdquo;, you are - undoubtedly - gonna fail. You are gonna fail so hard, that you will never come back to programming, ever.</p>
<p>Programming is a really wide concept. You could want to work with games, security, frontend things, backend web, devops, automating stuff, doing Math, or Big Data, or [reeplace with something you can do programming].</p>
<p>So, the field is really big, and if you don&rsquo;t know what do you want to do, you are going to feel lost, and then you are going to frustrate and fail. This article quoted by GVR, takes these concepts, and tries to guide newbies in the amazing world of programming. I wish I knew this article when I started my career in programming.</p>
<p>Read it.</p>
